### Hi there 👋

## Paulo Vitor Souza - Software Developer

### About me

I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on web and mobile development. With over 2 years of experience, I have a strong background in JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL, and I enjoy working with technologies like React, React Native, Redux, Jest, Detox, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, Hasura, and AWS Lambda.  

I'm experienced in building and deploying applications using AWS services like ECS, RDS, and Lambda, and I'm familiar with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and tools like Git and GitHub Actions.  I'm always eager to learn new technologies and tackle new challenges.

In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy and fiction novels (Shadow Slave is my favorite at the moment), and I love playing action RPGs like Path of Exile.
